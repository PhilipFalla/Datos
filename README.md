# ðŸ“š Data Structures â€“ Class Repository

This repository contains all the work completed for the Data Structures course. It includes theoretical analysis, practical exercises, midterm assignments, and in-class activities. The focus was on understanding and implementing core data structures, analyzing algorithmic complexity, and building hands-on projects that apply these structures in real use cases.

## âœ… Topics Covered

### ðŸ§± Data Structures Implemented
- **Arrays**
- **Stacks**
- **Queues**
- **Linked Lists**
  - Includes a reversal method
- **Binary Trees**
- **Binary Search Trees (BST)**
  - Includes a custom delete-node method and real use case in a Jupyter Notebook
- **AVL Trees**

### ðŸ“Š Time Complexity Experiments
- **Midterm I**: Compared complexity of search vs delete (`pop`) operations across structures.
- **Midterm II**: Analyzed AVL Trees vs Binary Search Trees in terms of time complexity.
- **Complejidad**: Tested time complexity with simple for-loop implementations:
  - Linear search (`O(n)`)
  - Product pair search (`O(nÂ²)`)

### ðŸ’» Projects & Practical Work
- **Geet (`MyGeet/`)**: A simplified Git clone with basic commands:
  - `init`, `add`, `commit`, etc
- **BST Use Case (`bst&tarea/`)**: Notebook demonstrating the delete operation in different scenarios.
- **CLI Homework (`Tarea_CLI/`)**: Used the `click` Python package to create a basic command-line interface with test commands.
- **Directory Tree Generator (`Directory Tree/`)**: Simulated directory scanning where file paths are nodes in a custom tree structure.
- **Linked List Reversal Tests (`reverse-ll/`)**: Created the method for reversing a linked list and it's tests.
